# wanna

```bash
$ wanna do something  
```

## `What do you wanna do?`

`wanna` is a super simple CLI app for keeping track of things you "wanna" do. Let's
say you are an avid baker and reader. You could tell `wanna` about some things you'd
like to do:

```bash
$ wanna bake cookies
$ wanna bake brownies
$ wanna read Mistborn
$ wanna read "Les Miserables"
```

Then, when you're in a baking mood:

```bash
$ wanna bake something
You should bake brownies!
```

Or in a reading mood:

```bash
$ wanna read something
You should read Les Miserables!
```

Or if you just wanna do something:

```bash
$ wanna do something
You should bake cookies!
```

`wanna` is semantically inspired by [`so`](https://github.com/samtay/so).
