# wanna Roadmap

## Alpha / MVP
 - [x] Platform-specific data location
 - [x] Suggestion of similar known names (via edit-distance)
 - [ ] Base feature set
   - [x] Writing wannas (`wanna {verb} {name}`)
   - [x] Reading wannas (`wanna {verb} [something]` / `wanna do something`)
   - [ ] Sequencing wannas (`wanna {verb} {name} after {name}`)
   - [ ] Prioritizing wannas (`wanna finish {name}`)
   - [ ] Completing wannas (`wanna mark {name} done`)

## Potential features (to be fleshed out)
 - [ ] Alternate suggestion modes (round robin vs random)
 - [ ] Terminal colors
 - [ ] Shell completions (+Fig)
 - [ ] Listing all wannas
 - [ ] Bulk actions for applicable cases (`wanna mark everything done` etc)
 - [ ] Followup prompting (responds to `wanna finish something` with `What would you like to finish?`)
